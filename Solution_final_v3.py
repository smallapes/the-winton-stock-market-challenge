## **Abstract** <a class="anchor" id="abstract"></a>
#
# This is a solution for the [The Winton Stock Market Challenge Kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/the-winton-stock-market-challenge).
#
# Since predicting stock market returns is notoriously hard, we will expect it to be difficult to beat
# a naive baseline model of just predicting mean returns of the training period. Also, since this is a
# *hiring competition* we will suspect the data set has been created in such a way, that dealing with
# important factors such as missing value imputation, numerical vs categorical features, colinearity,
# normalization, grouping and model robustness will be essential for competitors to demonstrate adequate
# skillsets in. Also, we note that we are here to win a Kaggle competition - not to make an actually viable 
# trading algorithm. 
#
# There where 832 teams participating in the Kaggle competition. This solution has a Private Score of 1727.86647 and
# a Public Score of 1769.92199 and would have ranked as number 4 (top 0.5%) on the Private Leaderboard.

### **1.1 Data Overview** <a class="anchor" id="data_overview"></a>
#
# In this competition, the challenge is to predict the return of a stock, given the history of the past few days.
#
# We provide 5-day windows of time, days D-2, D-1,
# D, D+1, and D+2. You are given returns in days
# D-2, D-1, and
# part of day D, and you are asked to predict the returns in the rest of day D, and in days
# D+1 and D+2.
#
# During day D, there is intraday return data, which are the returns at different points in
# the day. We provide
# 180 minutes of data, from t=1 to t=180. In the training set, you are given
# the full 180 minutes, in the test
# set just the first 120 minutes are provided.
#
# For each 5-day window, we also provide 25 features, Feature_1
# to Feature_25. These may or may not be useful
# in your prediction.
#
# Each row in the dataset is an arbitrary stock at an arbitrary 5 day time window.
#
# How these returns are calculated is defined by Winton, and will not to be revealed to you in this competition.
# The data set is designed to be representative of real data and so should bring about a number of challenges.
#

### **1.2 Evaluation** <a class="anchor" id="evaluation"></a>
#
# Submissions are evaluated using the Weighted Mean Absolute Error. Each return
# you predicted is compared with the actual return. The formula is then
#
# $$
# MAE = \frac{1}{n}\sum\limits_{i=1}^{n} w_i \cdot \left|y_i - \hat{y_i}\right|,
# $$
#
# where $w_i$ is the weight associated with the return, Weight_Intraday, Weight_Daily for intraday and daily returns,
# $i$, $y_i$ is the predicted return, $\hat{y_i}$ is the actual return, n is the number of predictions.
#
# The weights for the training set are given in the training data. The weights for the test set are unknown.

# %% [markdown]
### **1.3 Submission** <a class="anchor" id="submission"></a>
#
# The submission file should contain two columns: <font color=yellow>Id and Predicted.
# For each 5-day window, you need to predict 62
# returns. For example, for the first time window, you will predict 1_1, 1_2,
# to 1_62. 1_1 to 1_60 are predicting
# Ret_121 through Ret_180, 1_61 the prediction for
# Ret_PlusOne, and 1_62 the prediction for Ret_PlusTwo.
#
# The file should contain a header and have the following format:
#
#   <font color=yellow>Id, Predicted
#   1_1,0
#   1_2,0
#   1_3,0
#   1_4,0
#   ...
#   1_60,0
#   1_61,0
#   1_62,0
#   2_1,0
#   2_2,0
#   etc.


# %% [markdown]

#
# - train.csv - the training set, including the columns of:
#   - Feature_1 - Feature_25
#   - Ret_MinusTwo, Ret_MinusOne

# %% [markdown]
### **1.5 Data Fields** <a class="anchor" id="data_fields"></a>
#
# - Feature_1 to Feature_25: different features relevant to prediction
# - Ret_MinusTwo: this is the return from the close of trading on day D-2 to the close of trading
#   on day D-1 (i.e. 1 day)
# - Ret_MinusOne: this is the return from the close of trading on day D-1 to the point at which the
#   intraday returns start on day D (approximately 1/2 day)
# - Ret_2 to Ret_120: these are returns over approximately one minute on day D.
#   Ret_2 is the return between t=1 and t=2.
# - Ret_121 to Ret_180: intraday returns over approximately one minute on day D. These are the target
#   variables you need to predict as {id}_{1-60}.
# - Ret_PlusOne: this is the return from the time Ret_180 is measured on day D to the close of
#   trading on day D+1. (approximately 1 day). This is a target variable you need to predict as {id}_61.
# - Ret_PlusTwo: this is the return from the close of trading on day D+1 to the close of trading
#   on day D+2 (i.e. 1 day) This is a target variable you need to predict as {id}_62.
# - Weight_Intraday: weight used to evaluate intraday return predictions Ret 121 to 180
# - Weight_Daily: weight used to evaluate daily return predictions (Ret_PlusOne and Ret_PlusTwo).

# that intraday one min data is **_likely_** to be too noisy to be predictied by the data given in this competition. Hence we will only
# output predictions for {id}_61 and {id}_62 and output 0 for all of {id}_{1-60}.

# Here we will do initial data analysis. For each feature in the data set we look at the number of
# missing values, how many values are unique, how imbalanced the values are, how many potential

#
# - Feature_1, Feature_5, Feature_7, Feature_8, Feature_9, Feature_12, Feature_13, Feature_16 and Feature_20 contains few
#   uniqe values. These features are therefore determined to be categorical.
#
# - Feature_15 is highly imbalanced.
#
# - Besides being categorical, Feature_6 and Feature_7 are also distinct between the training and the test data sets.
#   However, Feature_6 is highly unique, whereas Feature_7 only contains relatively few unique values.
#
# This leaves Feature_7 as a special feature. We will try investigate this feature more thoroughly, by grouping returns by values of Feature_7 and
# look for a relationship in the sign of the returns to see if equal values of Feature_7 has correlated returns.

# We observe first that - as expected when trying to predict stock returns - each feature shows very litle
# correlation with targets (apparent from both the correlation heatmap and the regression plots). Ve also observe
# a high correlation between some of the numerical features - in fact there seems to be 3 distinct clusters of correlation:
#
# - [Feature_3 - Feature_11] correlates with [Feature_3 - Feature_11]
# - [Feature_3 - Feature_11] correlates with [Feature_17 - Feature_25]
# - [Feature_17 - Feature_25] correlates with [Feature_17 - Feature_25]
#
# within the numerical features. This is probably not coincidental, and it is likely that an optimal solution needs to take advantage of these relationships.
# In this solution, however, we will not investigate it further. We also observer that most of the feature distributions does not
# appear to be gaussian. We will deal with these issues in the [Data Preprocessing](#data_preprocessing) section.

# try to forces the distribution to be gaussian by using a quantile transformation. This is justified by the tendency of
# linear estimators to perform better on gaussian distributions. We also cut off values which lies
# more than 3 standard deviations from the centre to improve our handling of outliers.
#
# For ordered categorical features, we encode them using OrdinalEncoder to preserve the ordering.
#
# For unordered categorical features, we remove correlations between features by using PCA whitening and then one-hot encode so we can
# use models in the model building step that does not deal natively with categorical features.
#
# Finally, we normalize all features using l2-norm. The last step seems to improve l2-regulized regression significantly.
#
# *NOTE: We would have expected that PCA whitening of the numerical features would be beneficial for model performance since
# many of the numerical features are highly correlated. However, the opposite seems to be true. Perhaps the correlation clusters
# apparent in the correlation heatmap contains interesting information. We will leave it to a future improvement to try to
# investigate this further.*
#
# For target returns, we also use a quantile transformation to force the distribution of returns (which are not normally gaussian)
# into a gaussian distribution. We could also have used log transformation, but quantile transformation yields a better
# model performance.

# We see that most distributions of the numerical features as well as the targets now appear "smooth" and more "gaussian-like". But we also observe
# that some features still have a some degree of imbalance. We will not deal with this issue further, but note that
# we could remove the problematic rows at the risk of loosing other valueable data points.
#
# It is not really easy to interpret the transposed output of the preprocessed categorical features. We will just note that nothing sticks out as odd.
#
# Finally, we observe that after the preprocessed step, the individual features still shows very little sign of any relationship with the targets.

# We will focus on LinearSVR regression (wrapper for liblinear) with l2 regularization, as this method seems to deals particullary well
# with data with a very low Signal-to-noise ratio as one would expect from financial data. It is also a very fast algorithm (liblinear is heavily optimized).
# We will do a grid search with 5-fold GroupKFold cross-validation. As mentioned earlier, the fact that returns are not independent of Feature_7, we will have
# to group our cross-validation in order to avoid data leakage and hence overestimation of the CV performance*.
#
# Ideally, we should optimize using a loss function suitable for optimizing Weighed Mean Absolute Error (which is non-differentiable at 0). We did not
# prioritize this, and we still got reasonable results in the model scoring.

### **6.1 Improvements** <a class="anchor" id="improvements"></a>
#
# We will briefly touch on a few possible improvements to potentially increase model performance:
#
#   - Ordinal vs nominal categorical variables: It would be interesting to investigate this further. Perhaps come up with
#     ways to auto-identify them (based on eg. distribution?).
#
#   - Ensemble: We did not investigate ensemble models. This is one of the usual ways to improve final models performance.
#
#   - Features interaction. Simple feature interaction did not improve model performance, but more selective feature interaction might do.


# %% [markdown]
### **6.2 Final Notes** <a class="anchor" id="final_notes"></a>
#
# As stated above this solution fairs relatively favourable when compared to the Kaggle benchmark. However,
# there is a **lot** more to building a profitable trading model. Just because we can beat the baseline model does not
# guarantee the model can be exploited - ie, market frictions (trade cost, trade impact or overnight position costs) might
# adversely impact the models performance in a real trading setup. Ideally, we would need to design a trading system using the model
# and optimize a trading metric such as Sharp Ratio. We would also need to test such a system by successively retrain and retest
# it on a given set of time windows moving forward in time. On top of all this, we would of course also need an adequate portfolio optimization and risk
# management system.
